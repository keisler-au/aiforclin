        <h3>1. Accountability</h3>
        <p class="content-section-text">
          Responsibility is taken by the user for any decisions made based on, or as a result of an AI-generated product.
        </p>
        <p class="content-section-text">
          The user ensures proper oversight of AI-generated products to avoid any potential harm or liabilities.
        </p>
        <p class="content-section-text">
          AI is not a suitable substitute for a trained professional service that psychologists provide. All intervention models/strategies should all be based on accepted industry standards to ensure quality of the services provided as per the relevant APS/AHPRA ethical guidelines and standards as appropriate your relevant profession.
        </p>
        <p class="content-section-text">
          Due to the risk of plagiarism, it is encouraged that user seek the sources of information and use plagiarism checkers where appropriate. It may also be required to recognise and reference your sources of information when using AI for research or information gathering.

      <article class="content-section" id="inaccuracy">
        <h3>2. Potential inaccuracy of AI Job Produced</h3>
        <p class="content-section-text">
          Recognise that AI may produce work which is low quality or whereby the quality is unclear.
        </p>
        <p class="content-section-text">
          AI-generated content requires repeated human review and validation.
        </p>
        <p class="content-section-text">
          Ensure that you update and educate yourself about the capabilities and limitations of AI tools.
        </p>
        <p class="content-section-text">
          Recognise that AI tools are still being developed and evaluated, and as such their use in professional settings is still considered highly experimental. It may make mistakes, at times convincingly.
        </p>
        <p class="content-section-text">
          Use AI tools only when they can be justified and the risks are understood. Ensure that ethical guidelines for AI usage are followed at all times.

      <article class="content-section" id="prohibited">
        <h3>3. Prohibited Uses</h3>
        <p class="content-section-text">
          Avoid using AI for academic tasks that would misrepresent one's own capabilities or be considered 'excessive' (e.g. having the AI complete mandated psychology internship tasks fully for you when the intention is that you do these yourself).
        </p>
        <p class="content-section-text">
          Do not use AI tools to complete assignments, tests, or other evaluative measures in a way that would violate standards of academic integrity. If you are studying, you should ensure that you have checked your institution's policy around the use of AI prior to use.
        </p>
        <p class="content-section-text">
          Recognise and analyse when there is significance in AI's role in achieving the overall objectives in particular tasks which may benefit from human involvement.

      <article class="content-section" id="bias">
        <h3>4. Data Bias</h3>
        <p class="content-section-text">
          Be aware of the potential biases in AI algorithms and datasets. Recognise the potential for AI to make biased and stereotyped responses based on flawed, limited or incomplete data.
        </p>
        <p class="content-section-text">
          Regularly review, fact check and update AI tools where possible to minimise biases.

      </article>

      <article class="content-section" id="confidentiality">
        <h3>5. Confidentiality</h3>
        <p class="content-section-text">
          Ensure that any personal or sensitive data (e.g. names, date of birth, addresses, names of family members) used in conjunction with AI tools is deidentified and if necessary kept confidential and secure.
        </p>
        <p class="content-section-text">
          Do not share confidential information without proper consent (ideally written where possible).
        </p>
        <p class="content-section-text">
          You acknowledge that there may be legal, ethical and moral risks with AI if you choose to use any confidential client information even with client consent.
        </p>
        <p class="content-section-text">
          It is encouraged that data be deleted from AI systems at the earliest reasonable opportunity.

      <article class="content-section" id="transparency">
        <h3>6. Transparency</h3>
        <p class="content-section-text">
          Ideally before any service begins and with consent, seek to be transparent to the reader, client, peer or stakeholder about the use of AI in research, practice, and professional decision-making.

        <h3>7. Continued Education</h3>

        </p>
        <p class="content-section-text">
          a) Human, societal and environmental wellbeing; AI systems should benefit individuals, society and the environment.
        </p>
        <p class="content-section-text">
          b) Human-centred values; AI systems should respect human rights, diversity, and the autonomy of individuals.
        </p>
        <p class="content-section-text">
          c) Fairness; In that AI systems should be inclusive and accessible, and should not involve or result in unfair discrimination against individuals, communities or groups.

          e) Reliability and safety; In that AI systems should reliably operate in accordance with their intended purpose.
        </p>
        <p class="content-section-text">
          f) Transparency and explainability; There should be transparency and responsible disclosure so people can understand when they are being significantly impacted by AI, and can find out when an AI system is engaging with them.
        </p>
        <p class="content-section-text">
          g) Contestability; When an AI system significantly impacts a person, community, group or environment, there should be a timely process to allow people to challenge the use or outcomes of the AI system.
        </p>
        <p class="content-section-text">
          h) Accountability; People responsible for the different phases of the AI system lifecycle should be identifiable and accountable for the outcomes of the AI systems, and human oversight of AI systems should be enabled.
