        <h3 class="card-title">1. Accountability</h3>
        <p class="card-text--bulk">
          Responsibility is taken by the user for any decisions made based on,
          or as a result of an AI-generated product.
        </p>
        <p>
          The user ensures proper oversight of AI-generated products to avoid
          any potential harm or liabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          AI is not a suitable substitute for a trained professional service
          that psychologists provide. All intervention models/strategies should
          all be based on accepted industry standards to ensure quality of the
          services provided as per the relevant APS/AHPRA ethical guidelines and
          standards as appropriate your relevant profession.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to the risk of plagiarism, it is encouraged that user seek the
          sources of information and use plagiarism checkers where appropriate.
          It may also be required to recognise and reference your sources of
          information when using AI for research or information gathering.

        <h3 class="card-title">2. Potential inaccuracy of AI Job Produced</h3>
        <p class="card-text--bulk">
          Recognise that AI may produce work which is low quality or whereby the
          quality is unclear.
        </p>
        <p>
          AI-generated content requires repeated human review and validation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ensure that you update and educate yourself about the capabilities and
          limitations of AI tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recognise that AI tools are still being developed and evaluated, and
          as such their use in professional settings is still considered highly
          experimental. It may make mistakes, at times convincingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use AI tools only when they can be justified and the risks are
          understood. Ensure that ethical guidelines for AI usage are followed
          at all times.

        <h3 class="card-title">3. Prohibited Uses</h3>
        <p class="card-text--bulk">
          Avoid using AI for academic tasks that would misrepresent one's own
          capabilities or be considered 'excessive' (e.g. having the AI complete
          mandated psychology internship tasks fully for you when the intention
          is that you do these yourself).
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not use AI tools to complete assignments, tests, or other
          evaluative measures in a way that would violate standards of academic
          integrity. If you are studying, you should ensure that you have
          checked your institution's policy around the use of AI prior to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recognise and analyse when there is significance in AI's role in
          achieving the overall objectives in particular tasks which may benefit
          from human involvement.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card no-hover card--transparent" id="bias">
        <h3 class="card-title">4. Data Bias</h3>
        <p class="card-text--bulk">
          Be aware of the potential biases in AI algorithms and datasets.
          Recognise the potential for AI to make biased and stereotyped
          responses based on flawed, limited or incomplete data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regularly review, fact check and update AI tools where possible to
          minimise biases.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card no-hover card--transparent" id="confidentiality">
        <h3 class="card-title">5. Confidentiality</h3>
        <p class="card-text--bulk">
          Ensure that any personal or sensitive data (e.g. names, date of birth,
          addresses, names of family members) used in conjunction with AI tools
          is deidentified and if necessary kept confidential and secure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not share confidential information without proper consent (ideally
          written where possible).
        </p>
        <p>
          You acknowledge that there may be legal, ethical and moral risks with
          AI if you choose to use any confidential client information even with
          client consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is encouraged that data be deleted from AI systems at the earliest
          reasonable opportunity.

        <h3 class="card-title">6. Transparency</h3>
        <p class="card-text--bulk">
          Ideally before any service begins and with consent, seek to be
          transparent to the reader, client, peer or stakeholder about the use
          of AI in research, practice, and professional decision-making.

        <p class="card-text--bulk">
          As AI technology continues to evolve, it is important for
          psychologists, provisional psychologists and psychology students to
          stay informed about new developments and best practices in the field.
        </p>
        <p>

          AI Ethics principles

        <p>
          a) Human, societal and environmental wellbeing; AI systems should
          benefit individuals, society and the environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          b) Human-centred values; AI systems should respect human rights,
          diversity, and the autonomy of individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          d) Privacy protection and security; AI systems should respect and
          uphold privacy rights and data protection, and ensure the security of
          data.
        </p>
        <p>
          e) Reliability and safety; In that AI systems should reliably operate
          in accordance with their intended purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          f) Transparency and explainability; There should be transparency and
          responsible disclosure so people can understand when they are being
          significantly impacted by AI, and can find out when an AI system is
          engaging with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          g) Contestability; When an AI system significantly impacts a person,
          community, group or environment, there should be a timely process to
          allow people to challenge the use or outcomes of the AI system.
        </p>
        <p>
          h) Accountability; People responsible for the different phases of the
          AI system lifecycle should be identifiable and accountable for the
          outcomes of the AI systems, and human oversight of AI systems should
          be enabled.
